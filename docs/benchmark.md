# Benchmark

All results are from a 100-seed benchmark (seeds 0–99) on standard datasets. Each seed
produces a different random train/validation/test split, and results are averaged across
all 20 seeds to reduce variance from any single split.

---

## Methodology

**Split:** Each dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets. Models are trained
on the train set, the DES router is fitted on the validation set, and it is evaluated on the test set.

**Best Single** is the best individual model from the pool, selected by validation
set performance. It represents the baseline without any ensembling.

**Simple Average** is a uniform blend of all five models with no fitting or
tuning. It represents the simplest possible ensemble baseline.

All deskit algorithms use `preset="balanced"` (FAISS IVF) and `k=20`.

---

## Pool

The same five-model pool is used across all datasets:

| Model |
|---|
| K-Nearest Neighbors |
| Decision Tree |
| SVR / SVM-RBF |
| Ridge / Gaussian NB |
| Bayesian Ridge / Logistic Regression |

These five were chosen for having different inductive biases and architectures, which is the kind of scenario that
DES would be used in.

KNORA variants are designed for classification, which explains the poor performance
on regression datasets; However, some exception can occur in certain datasets, either where
feature space is has hard clusters (like in Concrete Strength) or when the target is discrete
and classification-like (like in Abalone).

## Timing

Mean fit + predict time in milliseconds, averaged across 100 seeds. Fit is measured once
per dataset per seed; predict is measured over the full test set.

deskit caches all model predictions on the validation set at fit time and reads from that
matrix at inference, so no model is called at predict time. This is the primary reason for
the speed advantage over DESlib, which calls each model live per neighbour at inference.

deskit used `preset='balanced'`, which uses FAISS IVF instead of KNN, but the difference
in performance isn't very pronounced in datasets of the size used.
