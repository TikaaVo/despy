# OLA

This algorithm is a DCS algorithm (Dynamic Classifier Selection), meaning that it selects a single model to have the
entire weight instead of ensembling multiple of them.

---

## When to use

- OLA is often used as a diagnostic tool or when one only wants to run the inference of a single model per test case to
cut down computation
- It performs best when the a single model is dramatically better than the others in a competence regions
- It performs worst when throwing away most models and only keeping one loses accuracy

## How it works

When `fit` is called, OLA fits a KNN algorithm on the validation data and builds a criterion score matrix, then normalizes
them globally with min-max normalization. 
When `predict` is called, it finds the K nearest neighbors from the test point and uses the score matrix to average
every models' scores over the K neighbors. Afterwards, it uses `argmax` and gives full weight to the model that had the highest
accuracy.

## Example
```python
from despy.des.ola import OLA

router = OLA(task="regression", metric="mae", mode="min", k=20)
router.fit(X_val, y_val, val_preds)
weights = router.predict(x)
```
