# DEWS-I

This algorithm is designed to be consistent and flexible for both classification and
regression tasks and is a variation of DEWS-U that takes neighbor distance into consideration.
It uses soft blending between the top experts in a certain competence region to compute a set of weights for the models.

---

## When to use

- DEWS-I is currently the general recommendation for regression tasks. DEWS-I works best with soft metrics, 
so it also works for classification with confidence scores, but not as well with hard predictions
- It performs best when the competence regions and pool are smooth and heterogeneous
- It performs worst for homogeneous datasets and for classification with hard predictions

## How it works

When `fit` is called, DEWS-I fits a KNN algorithm on the validation data and builds a criterion score matrix. 
When `predict` is called, it finds the K nearest neighbors from the test point and uses the score matrix to combine
every models' scores over the K neighbors with inverse-distance weights. Afterwards, it normalizes the average scores 
using min-max normalization and removes the models under a threshold. Finally, it takes the remaining models 
and creates weights with their scores using softmax with temperature.

## Example
```python
# Regression
from deskit.des.dewsi import DEWSI

router = DEWSI(task="regression", metric="mae", mode="min", k=20)
router.fit(X_val, y_val, val_preds)
weights = router.predict(x)
```

```python
# Classification
from deskit.des.dewsi import DEWSI

router = DEWSI(task="classification", metric="log_loss", mode="min", k=20)
router.fit(X_val, y_val, val_preds)
weights = router.predict(x)
```

## Notes

A lower temperature is recommended for regression because regression metrics tend to produce scores on a 
continuous scale where differences can be large, so a low temperature sharpens the softmax to reflect that. 
In contrast, classification metrics tend to produce scores that are closer together, so a higher temperature
keeps the blend soft.
